it turned out that 

set.seed(040590)
teid =  sample.int(size = 1000,n = 4176,replace = F)

on different machines and R versions may give different teid (see e.g. https://community.rstudio.com/t/getting-different-results-with-set-seed/31624/5)
however, even when this happened in the cases we tested, the results were consistent 
in the sense of BGNLM giving a slightly better performance on a hold out set than
other methods.

Please, let us know if you get any inconsistency in this sense here.
